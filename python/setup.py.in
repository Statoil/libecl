Introduction
------------
`ecl` is a package for handling an ensemble of reservoir models, an important
part of that is beeing able to read and write the files from standard reservoir
applications; `libecl` has quite extensive support for reading and writing the
result files from the ECLIPSE reservoir simulator.

`ecl` has a quite large amount of code devoted to reading and writing the
ECLIPSE output files (grid/rft/restart/init/summary). In addition, there is
also reasonable support for reading and writing the grdecl input files, but
there is no general .DATA file parser.
